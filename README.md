# Omenlight - Neon High Contrast  
A neon-inspired, high contrast theme for Visual Studio Code featuring vibrant bright green and electric red highlights.

This theme is designed around a bold, eye-catching palette with **neon green (`#00ff00`)** as the primary highlight color — giving notes, selections, and interactive elements maximum visibility. Neon bright red (`#ff0000`) flows like molten fire, sparking borders, errors, and warnings with intense energy, making your code visually pop while maintaining readability.
